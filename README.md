# PassCrack
Cracks a password using brute force. Length of the password which is being computed starts at one, and every character combination of that length is computed. If no combination matches the password in which the user entered, the length is increased and every possible character combination of that length is subsequently computed. This goes on until the password is cracked, checking to determine if the computed password matches the password the user entered after every new combination.
